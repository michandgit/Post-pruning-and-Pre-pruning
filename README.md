###Decision Tree Classifier
A Decision Tree Classifier is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the dataset into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the decision, and each leaf node represents a class label (in case of classification) or a continuous value (in case of regression).

##Pre-Pruning
Pre-pruning (or early stopping) aims to halt the growth of the decision tree before it becomes overly complex, thus reducing the risk of overfitting. Common strategies for pre-pruning include:

Maximum Depth: Limit the maximum depth of the tree. For example, setting max_depth to a specific value.

Minimum Samples per Split: Require a minimum number of samples to be at a node before splitting. For example, setting min_samples_split.

Minimum Samples per Leaf: Ensure that a minimum number of samples are present in a leaf node. For example, setting min_samples_leaf.

Maximum Number of Leaves: Limit the number of leaf nodes in the tree. For example, setting max_leaf_nodes.

##Post-Pruning
Post-pruning (or pruning) involves initially growing the tree to its maximum size and then removing nodes that provide little to no power in predicting target variables. This is typically done after the tree is constructed. Methods for post-pruning include:

Reduced Error Pruning: Nodes are removed only if the tree's performance does not decrease significantly on a validation set after removing the node.

Cost Complexity Pruning (CCP): Also known as weakest link pruning, this method involves iteratively removing branches from the tree to minimize a complexity cost function. The complexity cost function is a trade-off between the depth of the tree and its accuracy.
